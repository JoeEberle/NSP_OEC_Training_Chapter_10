    "Anaphylactic Shock": "A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that causes airway swelling, breathing difficulties, and a drop in blood pressure.",
    "Anticoagulants": "Medications that help prevent blood clots by interfering with the blood's clotting process, commonly referred to as blood thinners.",
    "Cardiogenic Shock": "A type of shock caused by the heart's inability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, often due to heart attack or heart failure.",
    "Distributive Shock": "A form of shock caused by abnormal distribution of blood flow in the smallest blood vessels, often due to sepsis, anaphylaxis, or neurogenic causes.",
    "Fainting": "A brief loss of consciousness typically caused by a temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain, also known as syncope.",
    "Hypovolemic Shock": "A type of shock caused by severe blood or fluid loss, leading to inadequate circulation and oxygen delivery to the organs.",
    "Neurogenic Shock": "A type of distributive shock resulting from a spinal cord injury that disrupts the normal regulation of blood vessel tone, leading to low blood pressure.",
    "Obstructive Shock": "A form of shock caused by a physical obstruction to blood flow, such as in pulmonary embolism or cardiac tamponade.",
    "Perfusion": "The process of delivering oxygen-rich blood to the tissues and organs throughout the body.",
    "Peripheral Vascular Resistance": "The resistance to blood flow in the arteries, which contributes to blood pressure regulation.",
    "Pulmonary Embolism": "A blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, usually caused by blood clots that travel from the legs or other parts of the body.",
    "Sepsis": "A life-threatening condition caused by the body's extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction.",
    "Septic Shock": "A severe and potentially fatal condition caused by infection-induced sepsis that leads to dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure.",
    "Shock": "A life-threatening condition where blood flow and oxygen supply to tissues and organs are severely reduced, leading to organ failure.",
    "Stroke Volume": "The amount of blood pumped by the heart's left ventricle with each beat, a key component in determining cardiac output.",
    "Tachycardia": "An abnormally fast heart rate, typically defined as a resting heart rate above 100 beats per minute.",
    "Tachypnea": "Abnormally rapid breathing, often a response to low oxygen levels or other medical conditions."
